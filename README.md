# SwissCollection (Yet Another Collection)

This collection provides a chain-based design to
easily transform and mutate arrays of data, whether
associative or not. Its goal is to be a swiss-army
knife of collections. If you need to do a manipulation,
its one true desire is for it be able to fulfill that
request.

Error checking is kept to a minimum to ensure performance
is high, and native PHP functions are used wherever possible.
Only when native functions cannot provide required
functionality are inline array manipulations performed.
